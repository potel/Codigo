Some additional notes on the MSU NSCL version of FOLD
-----------------------------------------------------

Explanation of those input parameters which are not explained in 
DOC_FOLD.LIS and are obvious:

Card 2) NR    : number of integration steps
	H     : step size (fm)
	ELAB  : bombarding energy in MeV  } These two parameters only used
	APROJ : projectile mass		  } for SNKE wavenumber determination
	IPRTR : set to 1 for printout of r-space densities
	IPRTQ : set to 1 for printout of q-space densities
	IPRTF : set to 1 for printout of formfactors

Card 3a) For the projectile...
	FJF   : spin of final particle
	PARF  : parity of final particle (+, -)
	FJI   : spin of initial particle
	PARI  : parity of initial particle (+, -)

Card 3b) Projectile (contd.)
	TF    : Isospin of the final particle
	TFM   : Isospin projection of the final particle (+ve = neutron excess)
	TI    : Isospin of the initial particle
	TIM   : Isospin projection of the initial particle

Card 3c) Projectile (contd.)
	NTYPF : see DOC_FOLD
	KOPTN : see DOC_FOLD.  The Z-coeff definition used by FOLD is


		 dJ,DT   CG(Ti Tim dT dTm | Tf Tfm) HAT(dT)
		Z      = ---------------------------------- * BHW
		 j,j'            HAT(Ji) * HAT(Tf)


		where,
			HAT(j) = SQRT (2j + 1)

		and BHW is the Wildenthal transition amplitude (as output
		by OXBASH, for example):

			                  +  ~   dJ,dT         
			      < Wf ||| (aj x aj')      ||| Wi>
			BHW = --------------------------------
			            HAT(dJ) * HAT (dT)


Card 3d) Projectile (contd.)
	IDF   : sub-orbital ID number for the final (destroyed) particle or hole
	IDI   : sub-orbital ID number for the initial (created) particle or hole

OLD CARD 5
----------
Card 5) FNRM1 : Normalization of SNKE Yukawa of 1st range given in force file
	FNRM2 :      "        "   "     "    "    "   2    "    "    "    "
	FNRM2 :      "        "   "     "    "    "   3    "    "    "    "
	FRCEFILE : name of file containing n-n force parameters
	For a list of available force files, see [DWBA.SCRI.FORCEFILES]
NEW CARD 5
----------
R.G.T. Zegers Card 5) has been replaced:
       FNRM1 : normalization of SNKE Yukawas (all ranges) for transformation
               from tNN to tNA 
       FNRM2 : kA (momentum of projectile in NA frame) instead of lab momentum
               Especially important for very light (A<10) target nuclei.
       FNRM3:  not used


Card 7) JR    : "relative" spin transfer (known in DWHI as LTRT)
	JP    : spin transfer in the projectile system (2*JP = ISTRT in DWHI)
        JT    : spin transfer in the target system (2*JT = JTRT in DWHI)
