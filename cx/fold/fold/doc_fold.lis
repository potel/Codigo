  ---------------------------------------------------------

  This program produces direct and exchange double-folded potentials 
  based on the Petrovich, Philpott, Carpenter and Carr formalism with
  central and tensor forces only.  [see NP A425 (1984) 609]

  The original model for the program is the Petrovich and Stanley 
  folding code which was also a model for ALLWRLD, but they have 
  diverged in general structure and detail.  This version handles 
  complex t-matrices and the simple Golin Fermi-motion correction 
  to SNKE in the AEA.  The option to use EXCHNG to actually execute 
  this correction exactly via Moshinsky transforms and the like is 
  untested and has not been converted to use the complex t-matrices;
  it should not be used.

  May 2005 - updates by R.G.T. Zegers NSCL
  The correction factors for the strengths were taken out (still listed in
  output but not used in calculation. The Z coefficients should be input
  like in DW81, i.e. the OBTD's from OXBASH multiplied by the common scale
  factors
  The SKNE approximation was updated: the kA parameter (see Love and Franey
  1985) is input as FNRM2. The difference is large for light target nuclei.
  FNRM2 is a common scale factor for the transformation of tNN to tNA. At 420
  MeV the correction is about 10% in cross section.

  Input structure:

     Most everything is read in I5 or F10 formats.

  1) KEXCHG, KPUNCH=1, FILNAM(char*8)

     KEXCHG =0(direct), =1(ZREA for C), =2(EXCHNG -- do not use!) 

  2) NR, H, ELAB, APROJ, IPRTR, IPRTQ, IPRTF

  3a) FJF, PARF, FJI, PARI    ---    for the PROJECTILE    ----

  3b) TF, TFM, TI, TIM

  3c) NTYPF, KOPTN, ALPHA

     NTYPF =1(static), =2(inelastic), =3(charge exchange)

     KOPTN =1(S[T]), =2(S[pn]), =3(Z[T]), =4(Z[pn]) =5(Wildenthal trans amp)

  3d) IDF, IDI, JX, Z1, Z2     (terminated by -1,-1)

      the Z's are the Raynal/ALLWRLD definition for MT=0
      conversion to actual MT can be wrong for special cases
      IDI corresponds to OXBASH's "created", IDF to "destroyed"

  3e) FILEN                    (read and used if ALPHA=0)

  4a) FJF, PARF, FJI, PARI    ---    for the TARGET    ----

  4b) TF, TFM, TI, TIM

  4c) NTYPF, KOPTN, ALPHA

  4d) IDF, IDI, JX, Z1, Z2     (terminated by -1,-1)

  4e) FILEN                    (read and used if ALPHA=0)

  5) FNRM1, FNRM2, FNRM3, FRCEFILE(char*48)

  6) NFORM                     (number of SETS of cards 7 and 8)

  7) JR, JP, JT, KFORCE
        KFORCE = -1  for Central + Tensor
	          0  for Central only
		  1  for LS (spin-orbit)
		  2  for Tensor only

  8) DNORM(1), ..., DNORM(7)   ---  card for each T, proj and targ

     these scale rho-m; rho-s for L=J-1,J,J+1; rho-l for L=J-1,J,J+1

  The following is from a standard reference run for MG-26(C-12,N-12)AL-26 at
  840 MeV in the laboratory using a corrected M3Y interaction.  The Woods-Saxon
  radial wavefunction files must be in the directory pointed to by the SET DEF
  command.  The radial functions are produced by WSAW.  The force files are in
  the directory NSCL_LIBRARY:[DWBA.SCRI.FORCEFILES] which should be logically
  assigned to FOLD_LIBRARY:  The SET VERIFY forces echo of the VMS DCL commands
  and comments but not of the input data read by the program.
