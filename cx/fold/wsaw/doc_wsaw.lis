  This program produces a file containing Woods-Saxon radial functions 
  where each is prefaced by a header that can be interpreted by FOLD.
  Based on a program written by Petrovich in the good old days.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

  Input structure:

     Most input formats are I5 and F10

  1) RMESH=0.1, RMAX=20., NPUNCH=1, NBPUNCH=150, IDBUG=0

  2) FILENAM

  3) TMC, TIZC, V0, A, R0, RC, VSO

     TMC = core mass

     TIZC = core charge
 
     V0 = starting value for volume potential depth (will be fit)
 
     A = diffuseness for this potential

     R0 = radius parameter for this potential
 
     RC = coulomb radius parameter

     VSO = spin-orbit potential strength to us

  4) EBIND, TMP, TL, TNODE, TIZP, XJ, XS

     EBIND = binding energy of particle

     TMP = mass of particle

     TL = orbital angular momentum (L) of particle orbit

     TNODE = number of interior nodes (starts at zero)

     TIZP = charge of particle

     XJ = total angular momentum (J) of particle orbit
  
     XS = spin (S) of particle


  arbitrary number of card 3+4 sets terminated by TMC = -1

  The following is from a standard reference run for C-12(C-12,N-12)B-12
  at 840 MeV using Woods-Saxon radial wavefunctions.  SET VERIFY echoes 
  the VMS DCL commands and comments but not the input to the code.  The 
  SET DEF is required to put the result file in the place FOLD expects 
  to find it for a later run.  Note that a second run is needed to get 
  C12N12 file that is also required; it uses 18.722 for neutron energy 
  and 0.601 for proton energy instead of the 15.957 proton and 3.370 
  neutron energy used below.
