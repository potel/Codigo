  This program performs the DWBA calculation using the double-folded
  scattering potentials produced by FOLD.  It is patterned after DWUCK 
  with the addition of better coulomb routines for the heavy ion case
  by Julian Cook.  It produces plot files suitable for PLOTIT.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

  Input structure:

     Most everything is read in I3 and F7 formats, see example below. 
     Definitions generally follow the DWUCK code this was originally 
     based upon, with a few variations.  Check code when in doubt.

  1) ICON(1), ..., ICON(20), TITLE

     ICON(1)=1  to use the kind of ANGLE input shown for card 2

     ICON(2)=2  to use a microscopic form factor

     ICON(3)=1  to use incoherent sum of the different LTR cases
    
     ICON(4)=0  to print form factor used, non-zero to suppress this

     ICON(5)=2  to print complex T-L, complex S-L, and S-L magnitude
            =1  to print no elastic scattering info
            =0  to print complex T-L only

     ICON(9)=4  to always produce a 4-cycle semi-log graph

     ICON(10)=0  to use non-relativistic kinematics

  1a) FILNAM(char*8)   --  read if ICON(2) is not 1, contains form factor

  2) ANGLE(1), ANGLE(2), ANGLE(3)

     ANGLE(1) = number of angles
  
     ANGLE(2) = initial angle
 
     ANGLE(3) = angle step size

  3) L, NFF, ISA, ISB, JA, JB

     L = number of partial waves for elastic

     NFF = number of form factors to expect  --  must match number 
           produced by FOLD; must also be used in correct order.

     ISA,ISB = 2 * projectile spin in initial (A) and final (B) channel

     JA,JB = 2 * target spin in initial (A) and final (B) channel

  4) DR, NNR   --   must match corresponding card in FOLD

  5a) E, FM, Z, FMA, ZA, RY, FS, QCD    ---  incoming channel

     E = lab energy

     FM,Z = projectile mass and Z

     FMA,ZA = target mass and Z

     RY = coulomb radius (multiplies TARGET mass to 1/3)

     FS = 0

     QCD = 0

  5b) FZ, VR, RY, AR, VSOR, VI, RZ, AI, VSOI, PWR  (until FZ=0)

     FZ = potential option (1=WS, 2=surface WS, 3=second derivative)

     VR,RY,AR,VSOR = real volume, radius, diffuseness, and LS values

     VI,RZ,AI,VSOI = imaginary volume, radius, diffuseness, and LS

     PWR = 0 for cases we use

  6a) E, FM, Z, FMA, ZA, RY, FS, QCD    ---  outgoing channel

     E = Q-value here

  6b) FZ, VR, RY, AR, VSOR, VI, RZ, AI, VSOI, PWR  (until FZ=0)

  7) LTRT, ISTRT, JTRT          (there are NFF pairs of 7 and 8)

     LTRT = JR, ISTRT = 2*JP, JTRT = 2*JT

  8) BETAR=0, BETAI=0, BETAC=0, FNORM=1

  9) PLOTFILE(char*16)

  The following is from a standard reference run for MG-26(C-12,N-12)AL-26
  at 840 MeV in the laboratory using the Roussel-Chomaz optical potential
  and the potentials produced by the standard case in the documentation for
  FOLD.  The SET VERIFY and SET DEF are redundant if this input follows 
  a FOLD run in a single batch file, as is normally done.
