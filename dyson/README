Hey, I put the combined (d,p) + dom code on github. I can make private
repositories now, so I need to know your github account so I can give
you access to it.

I added a clearly blocked out section in calli.cpp showing how to use
the DOM code for what you need. I included comments to help you
understand what each function returns. The code compiles, but when I run it I get a message that I can't read. I assume you'll know how to go from here though.

Run "make calli" for the combined code. Run "make green" to use the
purely DOM code that outputs various aspects of the Green's functions to
view in plots.

The regular/irregular function method is still not complete for the
nonlocal case. I've indicated the different functions you need to use in
the mean time (inverting the dyson equation at negative energies, and
going through k-space for positive energies).
